The problem of the project is a real-time finger counter. A deep learning model
was used for input images classification into 6 classes - number of open fingers.
Input data is grayscale images of 128 by 128 pixels. All data was manually
collected and labelled. To classify images hand must be on solid color background.
In real-time testing environment some frames are necessary to average background
which subsequently used for image background subtraction. To build the model
Keras API with Tensorflow backend was used. Current model is convolutional
neural network with the following layers:
    1. Conv: 64 filters, 3 kernel size, 1 stride
    2. Max pooling: 3 kernel size, 1 stride
    3. Conv: 64 filters, 3 kernel size, 1 stride
    4. Max pooling: 3 kernel size, 1 stride
    5. Flattening layer
    6. Dense layer: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
    7. Dense layer: 256 neurons, ReLU activation
    8. Dense layer: 6 neurons, Softmax activation
For training adam optimizer was used with sparse categorical crossentropy as
loss function.
During training images were augmented using following transformations:
    - 30 degrees rotation
    - horizontal flips
    - zoom of 0.2 scale
    - vertical and horizontal shifts by 10 pixels
Current results:
    - 98 collected images classified into 6 classes
    - Validation metrics after 50 epochs are 0.8192 loss and 0.6939 accuracy
